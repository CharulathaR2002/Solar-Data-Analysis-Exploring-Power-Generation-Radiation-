# Solar-Data-Analysis-Exploring-Power-Generation-Radiation.
In this project, Analyzed solar data to predict power generation and radiation levels
 accurately. Used Python's Scikit-Learn library to implement regression algorithms tailored
 for solar data. Employed Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Bayesian Ridge Regression for
 power generation prediction, considering factors like solar irradiance and weather. Utilized
 Huber, Gamma, and Linear Regressor algorithms for radiation analysis, considering
 atmospheric and geographical factors. Aimed to optimize solar energy utilization and
 promote integration into energy grids for sustainable renewable energy solutions.
